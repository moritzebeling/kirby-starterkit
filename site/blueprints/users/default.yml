# User blueprints are used to create new user roles, define form fields for each user role and set role permissions.
# By default, Kirby only has the `admin` role, a user role that is allowed to do anything.
# The title is required, everything else is optional.
# The default user blueprint does not define a role, but a standard set of fields
# available for each defined user role with blueprints that only contain a title.
# More about users, roles and permissions: https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/users/managing-users
